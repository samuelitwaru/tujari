**I deleted all the database including all the file uploads to reduce file size on sending.**

================================== MY WORK LOG ===================================

1. Worked on the details interface in the following parts:
    - "Add to Cart", "Add to Whishlist" and "Rate Product" buttons  (responsivenes)
    - "You may also like these products" and "Products viewed recently" (Horizontal scroll)

2. Worked on the cart table. I made it smaller with 'table-sm' and placed a min-width on the product's quantity selector input because the quatity could not be seen when the screen becomes smaller.

3. Worked on the account interfaces for customer and vendor. However couldnt 
accomplish functionality due to some database faults below.


=========================== ACCOUNTS FUNCTIONALITY CODE =======================
* I have placed the "account" functionality routes in /Application/routes/customer/account.py where i added a new blueprint (just to ease my coding process) called account. So you can get rid of this blueprint and combine the routes in it in the customer blueprint.

* I did the same for account functionality of vendors

========================= DATABASE CORRECTIONS (SO FAR) ========================
* there is no relationship between Customer and CustomerAddress table. It should be there
* there is duplicated data between the Customer and CustomerAddress tabe. For example; email, even the customer's name appears in both tables.

======================================= HINTS ==================================
* Keeping the field names of the Models and Forms helps to ease work and accuracy especially when making update functionality.
* I would recommend flask_sqlachemy instead of SQLachemy (can be considered later since changing maybe disasterous)

========================================= GOOD =================================
* I love the macros in "helpers.html".. Makes work alot easier
